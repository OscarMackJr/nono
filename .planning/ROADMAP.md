## Phases

- [ ] **Phase 67: Clean-Host Windows Install** — The machine MSI installs to completion on a fresh Win11 host (VC++ runtime handled, service-start non-fatal) and the supervised/broker path works there via an interim, auditable cert-trust helper + docs.
- [ ] **Phase 68: macOS Resource-Limit Enforcement Fix** — `nono run --timeout` and `--max-processes` actually fire on a real macOS host (supervisor watchdog + `RLIMIT_NPROC`), re-validated with `NONO_RESL_HOST_VALIDATED=1`.
- [ ] **Phase 69: UPST8 Audit** — A DIVERGENCE-LEDGER audits the non-macOS slice of upstream `v0.60.0..v0.61.2` with per-commit dispositions, `windows-touch` column, and ADR-cadence review.
- [ ] **Phase 70: UPST8 Cherry-pick Sync** — The will-sync UPST8 commits are absorbed with D-19 trailers, Windows-only-files invariant preserved, cross-target clippy + full suite green.

## Phase Details

### Phase 67: Clean-Host Windows Install
**Goal**: An operator can install the public machine MSI to completion on a fresh Windows 11 host with no manual steps, and run the supervised/broker path there without manual `certmgr` work — the cert-independent half of "make the public release work out-of-the-box."
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent of Phases 68-70; can run in parallel)
**Requirements**: DIST-01, DIST-02, TRUST-01, TRUST-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A clean-host machine-MSI install completes (does NOT fail `1603` / `0xC0000135` STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND) on a fresh Win11 host with no VC++ x64 runtime pre-installed — the CRT dependency is satisfied structurally (bundled redist / `+crt-static` / declared-and-checked prereq, chosen at plan time).
  2. A `nono-wfp-service` start failure during install does NOT roll back the product — the install completes and leaves a usable `nono.exe`; the clean-uninstall invariant (no orphaned WFP filters / service registration) is preserved.
  3. `nono setup --trust-broker` (or equivalent) imports the shipped code-signing cert into LocalMachine `Root` + `TrustedPublisher` so `nono run --profile claude-code` spawns the broker on a clean host with no manual `Import-Certificate`; the helper states what it trusts and why and never silently weakens the D-32-12 gate for an untrusted binary.
  4. The clean-host trust limitation and the supported interim path are documented (e.g. `docs/cli/development/windows-signing-guide.mdx`), the cert + import step ship with the release, and the doc plainly states public releases use a self-signed POC cert for the supervised path until publicly-trusted signing lands (pointing at the `--trust-broker` helper as the supported path).
**Host gate**: Clean Windows 11 host (no VC++ runtime, no pre-trusted cert) for the install + broker-spawn UAT. Must use the production-signed MSI, not a dev-layout binary (the broker trust gate only fires from a signed Program-Files install).
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: no

### Phase 68: macOS Resource-Limit Enforcement Fix
**Goal**: `nono run --timeout` and `--max-processes` deliver real enforcement on a real macOS host — fixing the nono supervisor-watchdog / `setrlimit` bug surfaced as the Phase 65 gate-65-A "A5" finding (REQ-RESL-NIX-03 defect), not merely re-gating the tests.
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent of Phases 67/69/70; can run in parallel)
**Requirements**: RESL-MAC-01, RESL-MAC-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `nono run --timeout <D>` SIGKILLs the child at the deadline on a real macOS host — the supervisor wall-clock watchdog fires (it is nono's own cross-platform code; non-firing is a nono bug, fixed here).
  2. `nono run --max-processes <N>` makes the child's `fork()` fail (EAGAIN) past the cap on a real macOS host, via `setrlimit(RLIMIT_NPROC)` applied before `exec` (accounting for macOS `RLIMIT_NPROC` counting all per-UID processes — may need a different bounding strategy than Linux `pids.max`).
  3. `macos_timeout_kills_at_deadline` and `macos_max_processes_blocks_on_rlimit_nproc` both PASS with `NONO_RESL_HOST_VALIDATED=1` on a real macOS host.
  4. The fix touches cfg-gated Unix code, so cross-target clippy (Linux + macOS) is verified per `.planning/templates/cross-target-verify-checklist.md` and the macOS CI build leg stays green.
**Host gate**: Real macOS host for the `NONO_RESL_HOST_VALIDATED=1` enforcement re-validation (CI runners can't validate — they hang; the two tests stay env-gated off the runner).
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 68-01-PLAN.md -- macOS resl enforcement fix (setpgid + RLIMIT_NPROC): both Direct and Supervised paths, uid_process_count helper, host UAT + cross-target CI deferred
- [x] 68-02-PLAN.md -- D1/D2/D3 three-defect fix: parent-setpgid race + SO_RCVTIMEO platform-gate + RLIMIT_AS downgrade
**UI hint**: no

### Phase 69: UPST8 Audit
**Goal**: A DIVERGENCE-LEDGER inventories the non-macOS slice of upstream `always-further/nono` `v0.60.0..v0.61.2` so the will-sync set is known before any cherry-pick — mirroring the Phase 54 audit shape.
**Depends on**: Phase 55 (UPST7 cherry-pick wave closed — the cadence rule preserves linear ordering; independent of Phases 67/68)
**Requirements**: UPST8-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `DIVERGENCE-LEDGER.md` audits `v0.60.0..v0.61.2` scoped to the non-macOS surface (the macOS slice was absorbed in v2.10), inventorying every relevant commit with a per-commit disposition (will-sync / fork-preserve / won't-sync / split).
  2. The ledger includes a `windows-touch` column and an ADR-cadence review per the Phase 33 Option A `continue` rule (does not silently supersede the Phase 33 ADR).
  3. A diff-inspect note records the re-export / cross-cluster cross-check per the `feedback_cluster_isolation_invalid` lesson (don't trust `--name-only` isolation).
  4. Upstream is re-fetched at audit-open and the head SHA + refetch date are recorded.
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 69-01-PLAN.md — UPST8 audit (v0.60.0..v0.62.0 non-macOS divergence ledger; D-01 range correction: SC says v0.61.2 ceiling but audit extends to v0.62.0 = SHA 52809dda)
**SC divergence note**: D-01 extends the audit range from the SC-locked `v0.61.2` ceiling to upstream v0.62.0 (SHA `52809dda`), adding +3 tail commits. REQUIREMENTS.md UPST8-01 acceptance language should be updated to reflect `v0.62.0` after Phase 69 closes.
**UI hint**: no

### Phase 70: UPST8 Cherry-pick Sync
**Goal**: The will-sync UPST8 commits land on fork `main` with the fork's invariants preserved and the workspace green — mirroring the Phase 55 cherry-pick-wave shape.
**Depends on**: Phase 69 (audit dispositions drive the cherry-pick set)
**Requirements**: UPST8-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The will-sync upstream commits are cherry-picked with verbatim D-19 `Upstream-commit:` trailer blocks; D-20 manual replays are used where direct cherry-pick conflicts dominate.
  2. The Windows-only-files invariant holds (no `*_windows.rs` / `exec_strategy_windows/` drift from upstream) and the fork-divergence catalog is preserved.
  3. Cross-target clippy (Linux + macOS) is verified per `.planning/templates/cross-target-verify-checklist.md`.
  4. The full workspace test suite passes post-sync.
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: no

## Progress

v2.11 active (Phases 67-70). Phases 67 and 68 are independent and host-gated (clean Win11; real macOS) — runnable in parallel. Phase 69→70 is the UPST8 audit-then-sync pair (linear). Prior milestones (63-66) archived above.

## Future Cycles

### Carried v2-deferred requirements (from v2.8)

These were defined but deferred during v2.8 (not yet milestone-scoped):

- **REQ-WSRH-AUDIT-01** — profile-wide audit of which heavy-runtime binaries hit the `WriteRestricted` gate.
- **REQ-RLS-ATTEST-01** — evaluate `actions/attest-build-provenance` vs the existing sigstore/TUF + Authenticode pipeline.
- **REQ-UPST-RESID-01** — residual v0.44–v0.57 macОS-learn-diagnostics refactors (`b5f0a3ab`, `bbdf7b85`, `wiring.rs`).
- **REQ-DENY-PREFLIGHT-01** — Linux-host-gated `validate_deny_overlaps` preflight investigation (security equivalence already proven).
- **REQ-UNDO-TOCTOU-01** — full fd-relative TOCTOU hardening of `validate_restore_target` (standalone security phase, ~2-3 wk).

### Deferred to the Enterprise Distribution Milestone (next milestone)

The big distribution effort is scoped after v2.11, gated on the incoming publicly-trusted cert:

- **DIST-SIGN-01** *(BLOCKED on incoming cert)* — publicly-trusted Authenticode signing (Azure Trusted Signing) so the broker gate passes with no manual cert trust — the real fix that supersedes the v2.11 `TRUST-01` interim helper.
- **DIST-SILENT-01 (SEED-001, P0)** — silent/headless/unattended install + GPO/SCCM/Intune packaging + machine-wide provisioning + auto-provisioned secure scratch space.
- **ENT-EGRESS-01 (SEED-002, P1)** — enterprise-policy-managed egress allowlists reconciling `nono-proxy` + `nono-wfp-service`.
- **ENT-SIEM-01 (SEED-003, P2)** — structured security-event telemetry to Event Log / Syslog for SIEM/EDR.
- **ENT-MULTI-01 (SEED-004, P3)** — multi-engine pluggability (confine any `AI_AGENT`-labeled token).
- **ENT-ATTEST-01 (SEED-005, P3)** — signed/attested policy overrides via the external ZT-Infra ledger.
- **DRV-PROD-01** *(gated No-go/Conditional-go per ADR-65)* — production EV/WHQL-signed Gap 6b minifilter.

## Next

**v2.11 is active.** Start with the independent, parallel-safe phases as hosts become available:
- `/gsd:plan-phase 67` — needs a clean Windows 11 host for the install + broker UAT (production-signed MSI, not dev-layout).
- `/gsd:plan-phase 68` — needs a real macOS host for the `NONO_RESL_HOST_VALIDATED=1` re-validation.
- `/gsd:execute-phase 69` — UPST8 audit-then-sync (host-agnostic; cross-target clippy via CI for Phase 70).

**Repo MUST stay PUBLIC** until Microsoft approves the minifilter altitude (verify no `build_notes/`/`.gsd/` staged before any push). Real publicly-trusted signing is cert-gated and OUT OF SCOPE this milestone.
